<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I have some thoughts on offshoring that I&#8217;d be interested in getting some feedback on.  Agree/disagree at will.<br/><br/>If a software developer (BA,QA,PM, etc.) is little more than a typist then it makes perfect sense.   <br/>If I send work offshore it costs me 1/X times my onshore rates. <br/><br/>Let&#8217;s assume the average skill level is more or less the same onshore and offshore.  This has been my experience with my fellow thoughtworkers. <br/><br/>To make things easy let&#8217;s also assume a programmer in your favorite offshoring location (I chose India because it has the best food :) ) commands a salary that is 1/9th that of an onshore developer. I made up this number based on the first salary numbers I could find on the net. ( Indian developer ~10k USD (~450k INR), US developer ~90k USD)  If I&#8217;m way off let me know in the comments.<br/><br/>Even the most optimistic person will agree that there is some additional overhead that goes along with this setup.  For Example, network connections between the offices, additional development servers, and a certain amount of overlap of roles in each place.  Given our 1/9th multiplier these costs seem pretty minor. <br/><br/>There are other more substantial issues:  <br/><ul><li>Employee morale decreases on both ends when people constantly have to work late or get up early to have meetings across a wide spread of time zones. <br/></li><li>Network sluggishness makes sharing a common code repository difficult and leads to long  check-in cycles and/or painful merges.</li><li>Communicating requirements through typed documents is not effective and is even less so when crossing cultural boundaries.</li><li>People are blocked and can&#8217;t continue their work because they need answers from people who are not available.  <br/></li><li>Transparency is often low within a single office.  It&#8217;s almost non-existent when you add many time zones and thousands of miles to the mix.</li></ul><br/>The drags on productivity listed above can be mitigated to a fair extent:<br/><ul><li>Have team members alternate spending chunks of time working in both locations.  Getting to know all members of the team and working side by side with them in the trenches will increase morale, communication, and transparency.  Video conferencing equipment can help as well but isn&#8217;t a substitute for working together face to face.  This is a pretty significant cost.<br/></li><li>Collaboration tools like Mingle and Cruise can help keep people on the same page and ensure that you aren&#8217;t stepping on each other&#8217;s toes. (yep, I&#8217;m plugging my employer&#8217;s products)</li><li>Distributed version control such as Git or Mercurial are supposed to help with some of the repository issues.<br/></li></ul>When all of this is added up does offshore development actually cost less?  What have you observed?<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that on average the chances of poor outcomes are higher and the costs may not be significantly different.  <br/><br/>Why do I suspect that this is the case?  Here&#8217;s an anecdote for what I imagine is the average case of offshoring:<br/>Company A spends a lot of money on their in-house product development.  CTO Smith observes that development is slow(and getting slower) and that Company A is getting a poor return on their investment.  Because programming is like typing, they need more typists&#8230; at a lower cost.  They hire a larger number of programmers via the lowest rate offshoring firm available.  The project starts slowly.  When the project is well behind schedule the answer is to increase resources significantly, incurring additional cost.  Not much if anything is delivered and the quality of deliverables is very low.  <br/><br/>This is <b>not</b> a condemnation of offshoring. It&#8217;s a condemnation of that idea that a company which doesn&#8217;t run consistently successful projects onshore will be successful in running projects offshore.  It&#8217;s a challenge to find high performing people.  It&#8217;s a challenge to run successful projects.  Even under good conditions some projects will fail.  Offshoring adds additional challenges.  <br/><br/>Is it worth it to take on these additional challenges?<br/><br/>I think in many cases it is.  If we reviewed successfully offshored projects what would we find? My guess is we&#8217;d find consistently successful deliveries with costs in the realm of 1/2 to 1/3 what it would cost to develop onshore(I just made up these numbers.  Lawyered!).  These companies took the opportunity to scale up(or replace?) their already successful onshore development operation.  They would do so by creating a high end offshore team.  <br/><br/>Assuming my hypothesis is correct, I further suggest:<br/><ul><li>Quality BA&#8217;s, Developers, QA&#8217;s, PM&#8217;s are hard to find.  Offshoring should be utilized to scale up because you will have a  larger pool to draw from. You will assume  additional risk however you may also save a significant amount of money.  <br/></li><li>If costs are really the main driver for outsourcing, I think a company considering outsourcing should do two things:  1. Take a long hard look at why development is so expensive (and/or results are so poor) in your organization.  What makes you think doing things offshore will produce different results.  2. Consider co-locating the entire team, including stakeholders and business owners, offshore for the duration of the project. </li><li>Project success is impacted much more by the abilities of the people on the team than where the project is developed.  if you&#8217;re hiring average typists, you&#8217;re probably ok.  If you&#8217;re hiring average software developers, you&#8217;re in for a lot of pain regardless of where they are physically located.</li></ul><br/>What do you think?<br/></div></div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I have some thoughts on offshoring that I&#8217;d be interested in getting some feedback on.  Agree/disagree at will.<br/><br/>If a software developer (BA,QA,PM, etc.) is little more than a typist then it makes perfect sense.   <br/>If I send work offshore it costs me 1/X times my onshore rates. <br/><br/>Let&#8217;s assume the average skill level is more or less the same onshore and offshore.  This has been my experience with my fellow thoughtworkers. <br/><br/>To make things easy let&#8217;s also assume a programmer in your favorite offshoring location (I chose India because it has the best food :) ) commands a salary that is 1/9th that of an onshore developer. I made up this number based on the first salary numbers I could find on the net. ( Indian developer ~10k USD (~450k INR), US developer ~90k USD)  If I&#8217;m way off let me know in the comments.<br/><br/>Even the most optimistic person will agree that there is some additional overhead that goes along with this setup.  For Example, network connections between the offices, additional development servers, and a certain amount of overlap of roles in each place.  Given our 1/9th multiplier these costs seem pretty minor. <br/><br/>There are other more substantial issues:  <br/><ul><li>Employee morale decreases on both ends when people constantly have to work late or get up early to have meetings across a wide spread of time zones. <br/></li><li>Network sluggishness makes sharing a common code repository difficult and leads to long  check-in cycles and/or painful merges.</li><li>Communicating requirements through typed documents is not effective and is even less so when crossing cultural boundaries.</li><li>People are blocked and can&#8217;t continue their work because they need answers from people who are not available.  <br/></li><li>Transparency is often low within a single office.  It&#8217;s almost non-existent when you add many time zones and thousands of miles to the mix.</li></ul><br/>The drags on productivity listed above can be mitigated to a fair extent:<br/><ul><li>Have team members alternate spending chunks of time working in both locations.  Getting to know all members of the team and working side by side with them in the trenches will increase morale, communication, and transparency.  Video conferencing equipment can help as well but isn&#8217;t a substitute for working together face to face.  This is a pretty significant cost.<br/></li><li>Collaboration tools like Mingle and Cruise can help keep people on the same page and ensure that you aren&#8217;t stepping on each other&#8217;s toes. (yep, I&#8217;m plugging my employer&#8217;s products)</li><li>Distributed version control such as Git or Mercurial are supposed to help with some of the repository issues.<br/></li></ul>When all of this is added up does offshore development actually cost less?  What have you observed?<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that on average the chances of poor outcomes are higher and the costs may not be significantly different.  <br/><br/>Why do I suspect that this is the case?  Here&#8217;s an anecdote for what I imagine is the average case of offshoring:<br/>Company A spends a lot of money on their in-house product development.  CTO Smith observes that development is slow(and getting slower) and that Company A is getting a poor return on their investment.  Because programming is like typing, they need more typists&#8230; at a lower cost.  They hire a larger number of programmers via the lowest rate offshoring firm available.  The project starts slowly.  When the project is well behind schedule the answer is to increase resources significantly, incurring additional cost.  Not much if anything is delivered and the quality of deliverables is very low.  <br/><br/>This is <b>not</b> a condemnation of offshoring. It&#8217;s a condemnation of that idea that a company which doesn&#8217;t run consistently successful projects onshore will be successful in running projects offshore.  It&#8217;s a challenge to find high performing people.  It&#8217;s a challenge to run successful projects.  Even under good conditions some projects will fail.  Offshoring adds additional challenges.  <br/><br/>Is it worth it to take on these additional challenges?<br/><br/>I think in many cases it is.  If we reviewed successfully offshored projects what would we find? My guess is we&#8217;d find consistently successful deliveries with costs in the realm of 1/2 to 1/3 what it would cost to develop onshore(I just made up these numbers.  Lawyered!).  These companies took the opportunity to scale up(or replace?) their already successful onshore development operation.  They would do so by creating a high end offshore team.  <br/><br/>Assuming my hypothesis is correct, I further suggest:<br/><ul><li>Quality BA&#8217;s, Developers, QA&#8217;s, PM&#8217;s are hard to find.  Offshoring should be utilized to scale up because you will have a  larger pool to draw from. You will assume  additional risk however you may also save a significant amount of money.  <br/></li><li>If costs are really the main driver for outsourcing, I think a company considering outsourcing should do two things:  1. Take a long hard look at why development is so expensive (and/or results are so poor) in your organization.  What makes you think doing things offshore will produce different results.  2. Consider co-locating the entire team, including stakeholders and business owners, offshore for the duration of the project. </li><li>Project success is impacted much more by the abilities of the people on the team than where the project is developed.  if you&#8217;re hiring average typists, you&#8217;re probably ok.  If you&#8217;re hiring average software developers, you&#8217;re in for a lot of pain regardless of where they are physically located.</li></ul><br/>What do you think?<br/></div></div>

Great article&#8230;especially on the idea: If you can&#39;t do it onshore, why do you think you can do it offshore?<br /><br />Communication is a problem, Blocking is a problem, Perceived Savings is just that &#8230; Perceived.<br /><br />I actually put together my own post on the subject:<br /><br />http://www.customsoftwarebypreston.com/offshore-software-development<br /><br />Any feedback?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Brett Miller</div>

@Paul,  I thought about breaking out onshore/offshore/mixed but decided I didn&#39;t want to make an already long post any longer.  I think all of those different variables would be interesting to consider in the area of offshoring.  I know where I stand on them when it comes to onshore work(cross functional teams, collaborative, shared responsibility).  I&#39;m not sure if that fact that it&#39;s offshore or mixed would change my perspective on them.  I&#39;m guessing I&#39;d feel that those things are even more important when developing across distances.</div>

Hi Steve, Here goes my thoughts -  Offshoring in my opinion should be considered strategic where you are willing to go throiugh the pain and start reaping the benefits after a stabilization phase. e.g. Trainline program in Thoughtworks India. Tactical engagements (12-6 months less) do not deliver the value proposition including lower cost, ability to scale and access to large talent pool etc. Acutally in my experience though you will deliver you really go through a lot of pain as you point out. It does not make sense. In summray I would say<br />- Think really hard on what, and how long you are going to engage in a offshore relationship. It needs to make not only economic (cost) sense it should also take into account IPs being shared, capabilities being build (or lost)<br />- Cultutral fit of your offshore partner/vendor. Try explaining distributed and/or offshore agile to your customer :). Project success depends on this point, I think<br />- Before engaging an offshore vendor understand the value additions and track those during the relationship (this sadly I think never happens and the focus switches completely on preceived cost savings as the relationship progresses)</div>

@Anon - Thanks for reading my post.  I think I must have done a poor job of communicating because I&#39;m having trouble connecting your summary to what I wrote.<br /><br />&quot;So you find that there are NO benefits out of offshoring?  * Clearly 1/9th of the cost should not be considered as a benefit.<br />&quot;<br /><br />I explicitly described my vision of successful offshoring having quite large benefits(consistent delivery and 1/3 to 1/2 the cost).<br /><br />&quot;* Every manager who offshore the work is essentially an Id**t.&quot;<br /><br />I didn&#39;t say anything approaching this.  I would phrase is this way:  If you have idiot managers managing your project the offshored version is unlikely to turn out any better than the onshored version.(they&#39;ll both run out poorly) <br /><br /><br />&quot;* Only highly paid Onshore BAs, QAs and Developers can do the Enterprise Development/Engg work.&quot;<br /><br />The point I was trying to make here is that the lower cost providers in a given locale are almost certainly not a good bet for successful projects.  If software development was a commodity(or close to it) the lowest cost option might be a consistent winner.  If you have the skill to judge quality and aptitude you&#39;d be better off paying a 2 or 3 times the average wage for offshore talent.   <br /><br /><br />&quot;* If you still offshore, then you should rotate the onshore and offshore folks around the locations, but the onshore folks would be still paid the same while working at an offshore location.&quot;<br /><br />I said nothing about what people should be paid while they are on offshore rotation.  I&#39;d think this would vary based on where they live long term <b>and</b> how long they will be there.  The same goes for people coming onshore.  There are many other factors that would likely play in.<br /><br /><br />&quot;* There are no good Lowly paid - $10K USD - offshore engg teams.&quot;<br /><br />I won&#39;t even speculate on what the lowest amount is you could pay anywhere in the world for a good developer.  I will say if they are good and you are paying them less than average for their locale it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll be paying them that for long.<br /><br />&quot;And still you will not question the fact behind why would a typical Enterprise Engg development job should cost $100K per person.&quot;<br /><br />I would hope that a typical enterprise engineering development job pays what it does is because that person delivers more than that amount of value to the business.</div>

@Arron - Yep, Brooks Law is the key reason I think costs for failed projects are probably about the same on and off shore. In both cases they are bounded only by the amount of money the company is willing to spend.  Since adding large numbers of people doesn&#39;t help the project they both expand to chew up all available funds.</div>

I agree - the extra hidden costs are in management and collaboration/teaming. I would break out the organizational and teaming forms used too, like assembly line , functional team oriented vs. cross-functional team, collaborative/component build oriented. Other , shared responsibilities vs. divided. on-shore only vs. off-shore only teams or mixed on-shore/off-shore.<br />Its funny how the assembly line form always creeps back - I attribute to newbie/un-informed managers/management. My two cents.</div>

I would add a bit.  I think you are pretty close, but another factor that creeps in is that with the perceived lower cost.  In particular, when the first sign of schedule trouble arrives, the people managing the money tend to more quickly add programmers.  Then Brooks law kicks in, and suddenly, you have 10 pairs doing less than what 2 pairs could, plus several layers of management oversight, etc.<br /><br />As a fellow TWer, I want distributed models to work, but I am also suspicious of the motives of people who want to leverage offshore purely for cost reasons.  It usually comes from a deep misunderstanding of what drives software development cost in the first place.</div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>As a software developer it amazes me how many software developers simply go on doing what they&#8217;ve been doing without making any attempt to grow or improve. At some point I hop in the car and begin the drive home. It doesn&#8217;t take too long before I realize that it&#8217;s not just developers. Many people can&#8217;t be bothered to pay any attention to what they are doing in any setting. How many times during each trip do I come up behind someone in the fast lane (or carpool lane) going 10-20 miles per hour slower than majority of the traffic on the freeway. It&#8217;s at this point that I begin to wonder why they are doing what they are doing. This list usually amounts to something like the following:</p><ol><li>They think it&#8217;s ok because they are going the posted speed limit (or within some miles per hour of it)</li><li>They can&#8217;t stand the thought of anyone going faster than them.</li><li>They&#8217;re taking a moral stand against those going over the posted speed limit.</li><li>They like the far left lanes because there is never anyone close in front of them.</li><li>&#8230;</li></ol><p>As I get down the list, I realize that while there are some people who may identify with the reasons above, the majority of these people are likely just not paying any attention. They get on the freeway, merge over to the fast lane(s), and completely check out. They don&#8217;t notice the large line of cars piling up behind then. They don&#8217;t notice the frustrated people who resort to passing them in the slower lanes (at worst having to pass 2 or 3 lanes over). They&#8217;ve probably been driving many years and at no point have they noticed any of these things happening.</p><p>While I&#8217;m often happy to ridicule and mock them as we drive along, what I&#8217;d really like to do is lay it out for them:</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You are creating traffic</strong></span></p><p>As the cars pile up behind you the amount of congestion is increasing. Two cars driving slowly in the wrong lanes can just about block the entire freeway. Everyone else will be delayed because of you.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You aren&#8217;t gaining anything</strong></span></p><p>If you just move a few lanes over you can still go the same speed without blocking anyone.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You are creating a traffic hazard</strong></span></p><p>As cars rapidly approach from behind you they find themselves with the choice to either pass on the slow side or sit in congestion behind you. In either case you are causing the freeway to be less safe than it should be.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>Here are a few simple easy to follow rules</strong></span></p><ol><li>If you can&#8217;t talk and drive at the same time you either a) don&#8217;t talk or b) don&#8217;t drive. Take your pick.</li><li>You should drive in the slowest lane that can contain your speed.</li><li>Should the need to pass arise you need to pass in a reasonable fashion. Speed up at least 5 miles per hour faster than the person you are passing. After completing the pass move back to the prior lane if it&#8217;s safe to do so. If you can&#8217;t pass at a difference of at least 5 miles per hour than you should slow down and stay behind the car until there is a point when you can.</li><li>If you aren&#8217;t going faster than the regular traffic in the fast lanes you have absolutely no business in the carpool lane</li><li>If all of the lanes on the freeway are going a pace that is uncomfortable for you, perhaps you would be more comfortable on surface streets.</li><li>It is your job as a driver to know how many cars are in front of you and how far away they are, how many cars are behind you and how far away they are, what the pace of traffic is in the lanes to either side of you. If you don&#8217;t know these things you are an unsafe driver. </li></ol><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>So, what&#8217;s the point?</strong></span></p><p>I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s more than enough of me ranting about oblivious freeway drivers. The same thing applies to software developers (and other team members). You may not be the best or fastest at what you do but it is your job to keep up with what other people are doing to be better and or faster. I&#8217;d hope that you&#8217;re also trying to figure out how you could be better and or faster. Even if you aren&#8217;t, the one thing you should make sure you aren&#8217;t doing is holding back others or possibly even the entire team. One or two people clogging up the works is often enough to stall or seriously slow down even the most productive team. </p><p> </p></div></div>

Imagine for a second that you have  gallbladder cancer.  You&#8217;ve had it for a few year now but it&#8217;s recently been diagnosed.  As far as you know the cancer hasn&#8217;t yet spread to other organs but you wonder about it every day.  After consulting doctors, and friends and family you&#8217;ve narrowed down your options: you can try and move the cancer to one of your lungs, at least then your gall bladder should start to function more normally, wait around and hope  that a few massages in the area would turn it back into normal tissue, or simply do nothing and live with it.

These options seem pretty ridiculous, but wait there&#8217;s more.  Now imagine for a second that you were paying $100k a year(not to mention  maintenance cost) to keep that cancer.  Furthermore, let suppose that the cost of surgery to remove it is very low with a very high probability of full recovery.

Your selected set of options just went from silly to unbelievable.  What reasons might someone have for refusing to have the cancer removed?
<ol><li>The cancer has been around a long time. We&#8217;ve been living with it for a while.  Why should we get rid of it now?</li><li>The cancer might come around, we just need to give it a chance.</li><li>Won&#8217;t the other organs miss it when it&#8217;s gone?</li></ol>As silly as this sounds in a health care setting, anyone reading this most people figured out about two sentences in that I&#8217;m talking about a cancerous member of a software team.  It&#8217;s amazing how reluctant most businesses are to get rid of cancerous team members.  Yes firing people is hard, but if you are not capable and willing to do it when necessary then you are doing yourself a disservice.  People always seem to be worried about giving cancerous team members many chances to improve.   As if magically on the seventh chance the person will turn it all around.  We&#8217;re not talking about people who are on the fence, or people who have just have had had a bad couple of weeks.  Do we really owe chances to someone who has shown them self to be  cancerous?  Why?  Is there really a chance that someone will go from being cancerous to being highly positive?  What are the costs of doing this? What is the expected return on that investment?</div>

In the past year or so I&#8217;ve been aware of the <a href="http://freestateproject.org/">Free State Project</a>.  If it were somewhere other than New Hampshire I&#8217;d have to give it some serious thought(no offense to New Hampshire but I like warm weather and beaches). I think it&#8217;s an interesting concept and it&#8217;s led to me thinking about how effective it could be and how a true free state(as in nation state) might be created.  The problem I have with the FSP(other than the location issues) is that there&#8217;s a preset limit on it&#8217;s effectiveness.

As good as the state can get I&#8217;m pretty sure the US government would not allow it secede from the US.  The consequences of this are that the US government still gets it&#8217;s cut of personal and business income off of the top and the state is still subject to US Federal Law.  If there&#8217;s a supreme court ruling or constitutional amendment  to abolish abortion or outlawing gay marriage nation-wide NH Would still be forced to follow these rules.

Given the threat of a successful libertarian state to the US governments coffers, I&#8217;m fairly certain politicians, in their own interests, would have strong incentives to penalize the state as much as possible.  For example the government passes a law, if you don&#8217;t have government run schooling you don&#8217;t get federal road funding.  I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a law the unions could get behind.   Perhaps this is not the most reasonable example but in this particular example that has the state paying twice for both schooling and roads(because you know the us govt is not going to exempt the state from taxation for either).

I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s no decent spot on the planet left to create a new country(and I&#8217;m pretty sure if there was, 20000 libertarians wouldn&#8217;t have much luck getting control of it.  Is there another answer?</div>

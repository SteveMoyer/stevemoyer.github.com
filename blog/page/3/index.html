I recently read Cyndi Mitchell&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34197">The Half Agile Path</a> and I agree with her that &#8220;We are failing to advance good agile engineering practices at anywhere near the pace that we are advancing agile planning practices.&#8221;<br/><br/>


While I also agree with Cyndi that it is difficult for management to see the value of pairing and other engineering practices, I disagree that this is the main reason that these practices aren&#8217;t usually put in place. The much bigger reason is that Scrum at it&#8217;s most basic(not most effective) is mechanical.  Anyone in an organization can understand and apply scrum practices.  Short iterations, standups, product backlog, burn down. Hey we&#8217;re agile right!!!<br/><br/>


On the other hand XP practices like pairing, TDD, refactoring are much more difficult to learn and take a lot of time and effort to become effective at.  I think you can learn these things most effectively by working one on one with people who are already experienced at theses things.  This makes the cost of getting people to be moderately effective at Scrum fairly cheap and the cost of getting people to be moderately effective at XP practices very very expensive.  A fair number of people will never get there.  Additionally TDD and refactoring are made much harder by the large amounts of tech debt that have likely accumulated in the code base.<br/><br/>


With a development staff of 5-20 the costs of technical up-skilling may be possible to finance.  With a development staff of significantly larger these costs quickly become exorbitant.<br/><br/>


How can we overcome this problem?  I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to increase the technical ability of non-small organizations over the last few years. I&#8217;ve seen and been involved in a few different approaches and have some ideas. I&#8217;ll save that for another post.  Has anyone had consistent success in overcoming this?</div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I&#8217;m noticing an annoying trend at the client locations where I&#8217;ve been working.  The number of recycling bins in the offices are sky-rocketing.  Why is this annoying you ask?  Don&#8217;t you want to recycle?  Don&#8217;t you care about the environment?<br/><br/>While I certainly have some thoughts about those last two questions, they aren&#8217;t the reason for my post.  The reason for my annoyance is that the total number of bins hasn&#8217;t changed.  Corresponding to the sky-rocketing number of recycle bins is a plummeting number of waste baskets.  In many of the offices I&#8217;ve been in lately desks and cubes each have their own recycling but there are only a few waste baskets.  The planners of this no doubt imagine that trouble finding a nearby waste basket will cause people to generate less waste.  Unfortunately, what actually happens is that people just start throwing their trash away in the recycle bins.  If the goal was to simply change the color of waste baskets to blue then congrats and mission accomplished.  If the goals was to get the recycling and trash separated by the people generating them then these efforts have failed miserably.  We&#8217;re now at the same place we were 10 years ago, we can either pay people to separate the mixed trash and recycling or we can get cans side by side.  <br/></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Ok I&#8217;ll say it. I hate checkstyle. More specifically, I hate quite a
few of the standard checkstyle rules. What do the following code
snippets have in common?


<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[  
public void myFunction(){  
...  
}
]]></script>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[  public void myFunction()  
{  
...  
} </script>


<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[  
public void myFunction(String param ) {
  ... 
}</script>

That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s a good chance that they&#8217;ll cause the checkstyle limit to be exceeded on my current project, for the following reasons:
<ol><li>There is no space between the ) and {</li>
<li> The { is on a new line</li>
<li>There is a space before the )
</li></ol>


Too many checkstyle violations will cause the build to fail.  To remedy this enough violations will have to be manually fixed.  That&#8217;s the annoying part of it.  In my mind these type of white space differences are completely insignificant.  I know there are many of you out there who obsess about this stuff and I won&#8217;t get you started about tabs vs. spaces.  I will say that unless you have automated code formatting run on all modified files before check-in you should not have checkstyle failing your builds.  How much time has been wasted splitting string constants because they are over a certain number of characters?


How to avoid this type of BS:
<ul>
<li>Any white space formatting you can&#8217;t live without should be automatic and not require user action.</li>
<li> Only fail your build on errors, not warnings.  Also, the violations listed above should be set as warnings.</li>
<li>Before spending any significant amount of time feeding the checkstyle, fill out your TPS cover sheet first and have it ready to go.</li>
</ul></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
As in &#8220;There is no good reason to go beyond business casual&#8221;.  For some reason many individuals and companies have decided that the more dressed up a person is correlates positively with how much they have to offer as well as how productive an employee they are.

I would argue that where you dress on the scale (from anywhere above a greasy stained t-shirt up to a basic suit) indicates almost nothing.  I wouldn&#8217;t mark someone down for dressing at the level required by their company&#8217;s dress code but I would say that dressing above what is required is correlated negatively with skills and positively with the playing politics.  If we lived in the land of Pride and Prejudice this would all make sense but shouldn&#8217;t we have moved beyond using this kind of thing as a proxy with which to measure people.

There&#8217;s a reason all politicians and many sales people wear suits all the time.  They literally have nothing of value to offer.  When this is the case, it makes sense for them as individuals to spend all of their time trying to give the false impression that they are powerful and important.  Isn&#8217;t it time we stopped buying into it?

They always have their excuses.  I have to keep up with the competition.  First impressions are important.  Shaking hands and kissing babies isn&#8217;t as great for my image if I&#8217;m not dressed to the nines.  How about developing a real value proposition?  When I run into companies who are unusually casual for their industry(WAMU, Southwest Airlines for example) I often find that they are known for lower prices and friendlier service. 

I fairly consistently push the lower boundaries of the dress codes wherever I go.   I applaud people like my co-worker who showed up to work in a plain white t-shirt and jean shorts this past Friday.  Assuming you aren&#8217;t wearing a bikini or mankini the odds are good that nobody will question you.  If someone does, you either need to make yourself more valuable to the company or find a place to work with fewer folks who think that dress codes add value.</div>

I&#8217;ve bought  a new Nokia E71 and I was looking to transfer my contact list to gmail as an intermediate step to adding all my contacts to my new phone.  I stumbled onto <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138636&amp;ctx=sibling&amp;topic=14299">this</a> help article which helped me to sync them up.  The steps are for a windows mobile phone but I also found <a href="http://thesymbianblog.com/2009/02/10/how-to-sync-your-mobile-contacts-with-your-google-account-for-free/">a set</a> for the new nokia I purchased.  Once they are sync-ed you can use gmail to merge any duplicate contacts.  One sweet side effect of syncing was that all of my gmail contacts buddy icons will display on my phone when they call.  Quick and painless, just the way it should be.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;m now contributing to an <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.mises.org%2Farchives%2F009475.asp&amp;ei=3EMBS8eAKdOGkQXQn5zuDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPBhbbKD6ixs7DDVezEcZYmSKhKQ&amp;sig2=q2Sfn2kWNPGCihnyGlVwSw">recently open sourced project</a> .     I&#8217;m finding that the process of trying to help the project get going to be full of interesting challenges.  Before I dive into that, I&#8217;ll provide a little background.

The Ludwig von Mises Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the Austrian School of economics and spreading the ideas behind the economics of freedom.  Educating people about economics and freedom are particular interests of mine which is what has drawn me to the project.  They have open sourced the code for their websites as well as the books, papers, articles and media owned by the Institute.  The project has been open source for about 9 months an has not gotten much in the way of code contributions aside from the original programmer who has been working on the project in his spare time for about 5 years.  Like many projects and most single developer projects in particular, the projects has grown organically without automated tests.  Little attention has been paid to the amount of effort necessary to get a development environment up and running.  There is a large amount of data access directly in the UI tier as well as a large amount of business logic in the database.  Changes are manually pushed to production and some changes seem to be made directly to the production environment.  The feature request list consists of a few tasks as well as the output of a brainstorming session.

How can we take this project from a one programmer show to a thriving  open source project?

<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lower the barriers to entry</span> -  As I mentioned little attention has been paid to the amount of effort necessary to get a developer workstation up and running, and why should there have been.  On a single programmer project there is no cost associated with this,  the original developer has it compiling and running on his own machine and should he need to set up another he more or less knows what it takes.  Getting it running on my local machine for the first time took a couple of days.  For an open source project this kind of up front cost is unacceptable.  Even most of those who are highly motivated to contribute will give up fairly quickly if they can&#8217;t see a direct path to making valuable contributions. Most of the first week and a half or so that I&#8217;ve spent on the project has been dedicated to easing the process of getting up and running. <ul><li> So far: Checked dependencies into source control.  Set up a command line build which is able to build and run the app(including a local copy of the databases with some data) with minimal configuration after being checked out of source control.
</li><li>Yet to be done: Ensure that the data makes sense in the context of the app and comprises a representative subset.  Add more detail around installing prerequisites for running the app.
</li></ul></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decrease the risk associated of change</span> - Pretty quickly after starting to look at the code I realized that I had no confidence in being able to change it without breaking something, or perhaps even everything.  For example I pulled the business logic classes that were in the web site out into a separate assembly.  Getting the app compiling again was pretty easy but there were a couple places that the classes were loaded via xml that had been broken.  This went unnoticed for a couple of days.  I&#8217;d like to have a wide array of unit, integration, and functional tests.  The majority of the code is not unit testable.  I&#8217;m not comfortable  structurally changing it to be unit testable without some form of regression available. <ul><li>So Far: Installed CI to ensure that the code and databases compile after each check-in.  Explored the code and application to better understand the domain.
</li><li>Yet to be done:  Add integration tests and/or functional tests in the areas where a feature is to be developed, refactor to a unit testable condition when those tests are in place.  Add unit testing for areas of the code that I changed.</li></ul></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deliver business value</span> - I&#8217;m shocked and saddened that this is the third thing on my list!  I&#8217;ve been working quite hard for a week and a half and I haven&#8217;t delivered anything of value to the Institute.  I can&#8217;t decide if I should have delayed some of the build and ci related tasks and left them to be done in the near future.  On one hand I could have have knocked out a few tasks.  On the other hand a couple of fellow Thoughtworkers are willing to contribute and were able to get going much more quickly than I was.  Another challenge is clearly going to be communication bandwidth.  The team members working on the project are distributed  across the world.  In addition it&#8217;s being developed in people&#8217;s free time which makes it even less likely that their availability will line up to allow communication.
<ul><li> So far:  Some tasks and brainstormed ideas have been added to a wiki
</li><li>Yet to be done: Determine who the Business Owners and other stakeholders are.  Gather some user stories in a standard format (As a &#8230; I would like to &#8230;. so that &#8230;?).  Help the stakeholders to create a prioritized list.  Address availability of requirements or lack there of.  Wrap up non-value generating tasks so Business Value can go to the top of the list where it belongs.
</li></ul></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate interest and buzz</span> - I think <a href="http://www.rationalmind.net/">David</a> and the folks at the institute have done a good job of generating interest in the project by getting the news out there.  I agree with his assertion that getting more people to contribute more than just talk requires getting some exciting stuff done.
<ul><li>Yet to be done: Deliver, Deliver, Deliver.</li></ul></li></ol>
I&#8217;d appreciate any ideas, thoughts, comments, criticism, etc so feel free to fire away.</div>

Note: I wrote this post a while ago when it was bugging the shit out of me(12/10/08) but didn&#8217;t get around to finishing it up until now.

I&#8217;ve recently had a lengthy discussion with a Sr. Developer who swears by &#8220;the simplest thing that could <span style="font-weight: bold;">possibly</span> work&#8221; (emphasis his).  In his mind that seems to mean:
<ol><li>Lowest number of classes.</li><li>Performing many tasks in one place.</li><li>Using manual inspection of system level output to verify behavior.</li><li>Creating a large number of Utility/Manager manager classes which perform a variety of unrelated functions.</li><li>Wedging nested if after nested if into the code.</li></ol>The results of this are pretty easy to see:
<ol><li>A few God classes which perform many highly coupled functions.</li><li>Behavior that is very difficult to unit test except in the case where unit==system.</li><li>Constant merging of changes between developers working on things that in theory are not related.</li><li>Developers reluctant to make any changes because they have no idea what ripple effects those changes might have through the system.</li></ol>Clearly, obsessing on a single XP saying (without even really understanding it) makes for poor code.

Reviewing the info I found on the saying I sumarize:
Do the simplest thing that could possibly make the unit tests pass.  When the unit tests pass, refactor until the code is simple  and easy to understand.

That summary sounds a lot different to me than slapping nasty code into nasty code without a decent regression suite of tests.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In my <a href="http://codinglibertarian.blogspot.com/2008/12/cancer.html">last post</a>, I pointed out that I think we should treat cancerous team members more like cancer and less like team members.  <a href="http://thoughtadrian.blogspot.com/">Adrian</a> correctly commented that being cancerous is a slider and not a check box.  So, throwing out the easy to diagnose cancerous team member I&#8217;m currently working with, I thought it would be interesting to try and come up with some symptoms and warning signs that can help to diagnose whether your tumor is malignant or benign.<br/>

First, I want to draw a distinction between between unproductive and cancerous.  Simply producing very little does not necessarily make you a cancer. For example, your gallbladder does not do much for you when healthy, but it&#8217;s not until it starts causing you pain(and hurting other organs?) that you think about having it removed.  I would argue that the costs of keeping an unproductive team member are enough reason to strongly consider getting rid of them, but I don&#8217;t think they generally demand the urgency and immediate action that a cancerous team member often does.<br/><br/>

<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Team Member is not participating in optional team activities</span>
</span><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">
When it&#8217;s a risk factor:</span><br/> The person is MIA from most team activities.  There are many legitimate reasons why someone is unable to participate: family commitments, other personal interests, and other work activities for example.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When it&#8217;s a symptom:</span><br/> The person is generally(but not specifically) critical of team activities.  &#8220;Brownbag lunches suck&#8221; isn&#8217;t constructive/helpful.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When you have cancer:</span><br/> Everyone on the team breathes a sigh of relief when the person doesn&#8217;t show up.<br/><br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Team Member is disagreeable</span></span>
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">
When it&#8217;s a risk factor:</span><br/> The person stubbornly holds to their positions in spite of evidence to the contrary.  All of us occasionally dig our feet in the sand, at least it indicates that we give a damn.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When it&#8217;s a symptom:</span><br/> The person won&#8217;t present any reasons for their position.  It&#8217;s pretty hard to have a reasonable discussion with someone when they won&#8217;t present their reasons for holding a position nor hear yours.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When you have cancer:</span> Once a decision is made, the person refuses let it go, and brings it up continually.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Team Member is a distraction</span></span><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
When it&#8217;s a risk factor:</span> The person often distracts/interrupts another member of the team.  Sometimes a team member needs a distraction to take a brief mental break or the distraction is a request for help.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When it&#8217;s a symptom:</span><br/> The person continually distracts/interrupts the entire team.  Wasting one person&#8217;s time is one thing, wasting the whole team&#8217;s time is bigger problem.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When you have cancer:</span><br/> The person continually distracts/interrupts the entire team in a rude manner with things that are off topic and/or not related to the task at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nobody knows what the Team Member is doing </span></span><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
When it&#8217;s a risk factor:</span><br/> The person&#8217;s tasks are vague or not defined.  Some tasks are hard to define/describe, maybe someone with more knowledge of the area can help them.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When it&#8217;s a symptom:</span> The person is slow to finish tasks and unable to share task status.  Some tasks take longer than expected but hopefully not all of them.  When a person is almost done for long periods of time it&#8217;s definitely a smell.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When you have cancer:</span> When the person finishes a task is generally when someone else needs to pick it up and spend a lot of time fixing it.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Team Member refuses to change</span></span><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
When it&#8217;s a risk factor:</span><br/> The person has trouble growing their skills and picking up new ones.  Some people take longer to learn than others, if they&#8217;re making an honest effort it should eventually pay off.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When it&#8217;s a symptom:</span><br/> The person simply mangles new thoughts and ideas to fit their current world view.  With agile you need to create a first draft of your complete requirements quickly so you can get a couple iterations of work on it before having everyone sign off on it so we can start to design the architecture in detail&#8230;<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> When you have cancer:</span> The person actively discourages others from considering new ideas and putting them into action.<br/>
<br/>
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left out many signs and symptoms so please let me know of any that you think should be added to the list.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Imagine for a second that you have  gallbladder cancer.  You&#8217;ve had it for a few year now but it&#8217;s recently been diagnosed.  As far as you know the cancer hasn&#8217;t yet spread to other organs but you wonder about it every day.  After consulting doctors, and friends and family you&#8217;ve narrowed down your options: you can try and move the cancer to one of your lungs, at least then your gall bladder should start to function more normally, wait around and hope  that a few massages in the area would turn it back into normal tissue, or simply do nothing and live with it.

These options seem pretty ridiculous, but wait there&#8217;s more.  Now imagine for a second that you were paying $100k a year(not to mention  maintenance cost) to keep that cancer.  Furthermore, let suppose that the cost of surgery to remove it is very low with a very high probability of full recovery.

Your selected set of options just went from silly to unbelievable.  What reasons might someone have for refusing to have the cancer removed?
<ol><li>The cancer has been around a long time. We&#8217;ve been living with it for a while.  Why should we get rid of it now?</li><li>The cancer might come around, we just need to give it a chance.</li><li>Won&#8217;t the other organs miss it when it&#8217;s gone?</li></ol>As silly as this sounds in a health care setting, anyone reading this most people figured out about two sentences in that I&#8217;m talking about a cancerous member of a software team.  It&#8217;s amazing how reluctant most businesses are to get rid of cancerous team members.  Yes firing people is hard, but if you are not capable and willing to do it when necessary then you are doing yourself a disservice.  People always seem to be worried about giving cancerous team members many chances to improve.   As if magically on the seventh chance the person will turn it all around.  We&#8217;re not talking about people who are on the fence, or people who have just have had had a bad couple of weeks.  Do we really owe chances to someone who has shown them self to be  cancerous?  Why?  Is there really a chance that someone will go from being cancerous to being highly positive?  What are the costs of doing this? What is the expected return on that investment?</div>

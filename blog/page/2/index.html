<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>As a software developer it amazes me how many software developers simply go on doing what they&#8217;ve been doing without making any attempt to grow or improve. At some point I hop in the car and begin the drive home. It doesn&#8217;t take too long before I realize that it&#8217;s not just developers. Many people can&#8217;t be bothered to pay any attention to what they are doing in any setting. How many times during each trip do I come up behind someone in the fast lane (or carpool lane) going 10-20 miles per hour slower than majority of the traffic on the freeway. It&#8217;s at this point that I begin to wonder why they are doing what they are doing. This list usually amounts to something like the following:</p><ol><li>They think it&#8217;s ok because they are going the posted speed limit (or within some miles per hour of it)</li><li>They can&#8217;t stand the thought of anyone going faster than them.</li><li>They&#8217;re taking a moral stand against those going over the posted speed limit.</li><li>They like the far left lanes because there is never anyone close in front of them.</li><li>&#8230;</li></ol><p>As I get down the list, I realize that while there are some people who may identify with the reasons above, the majority of these people are likely just not paying any attention. They get on the freeway, merge over to the fast lane(s), and completely check out. They don&#8217;t notice the large line of cars piling up behind then. They don&#8217;t notice the frustrated people who resort to passing them in the slower lanes (at worst having to pass 2 or 3 lanes over). They&#8217;ve probably been driving many years and at no point have they noticed any of these things happening.</p><p>While I&#8217;m often happy to ridicule and mock them as we drive along, what I&#8217;d really like to do is lay it out for them:</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You are creating traffic</strong></span></p><p>As the cars pile up behind you the amount of congestion is increasing. Two cars driving slowly in the wrong lanes can just about block the entire freeway. Everyone else will be delayed because of you.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You aren&#8217;t gaining anything</strong></span></p><p>If you just move a few lanes over you can still go the same speed without blocking anyone.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>You are creating a traffic hazard</strong></span></p><p>As cars rapidly approach from behind you they find themselves with the choice to either pass on the slow side or sit in congestion behind you. In either case you are causing the freeway to be less safe than it should be.</p><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>Here are a few simple easy to follow rules</strong></span></p><ol><li>If you can&#8217;t talk and drive at the same time you either a) don&#8217;t talk or b) don&#8217;t drive. Take your pick.</li><li>You should drive in the slowest lane that can contain your speed.</li><li>Should the need to pass arise you need to pass in a reasonable fashion. Speed up at least 5 miles per hour faster than the person you are passing. After completing the pass move back to the prior lane if it&#8217;s safe to do so. If you can&#8217;t pass at a difference of at least 5 miles per hour than you should slow down and stay behind the car until there is a point when you can.</li><li>If you aren&#8217;t going faster than the regular traffic in the fast lanes you have absolutely no business in the carpool lane</li><li>If all of the lanes on the freeway are going a pace that is uncomfortable for you, perhaps you would be more comfortable on surface streets.</li><li>It is your job as a driver to know how many cars are in front of you and how far away they are, how many cars are behind you and how far away they are, what the pace of traffic is in the lanes to either side of you. If you don&#8217;t know these things you are an unsafe driver. </li></ol><p><span style=' font-size:large;'><strong>So, what&#8217;s the point?</strong></span></p><p>I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s more than enough of me ranting about oblivious freeway drivers. The same thing applies to software developers (and other team members). You may not be the best or fastest at what you do but it is your job to keep up with what other people are doing to be better and or faster. I&#8217;d hope that you&#8217;re also trying to figure out how you could be better and or faster. Even if you aren&#8217;t, the one thing you should make sure you aren&#8217;t doing is holding back others or possibly even the entire team. One or two people clogging up the works is often enough to stall or seriously slow down even the most productive team. </p><p> </p></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let me apologize in advance for my exasperation,  I&#8217;ve been working with TFS.
<br/>
My coworker Jonathan McCracken was too nice to MS Team Foundation System in his <a href="http://jonathanmccracken.blogspot.com/2010/07/mvp-microsoftfanboy.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MyIdeationHasFoundAHome+%28My+Ideation+Has+Found+a+Home%29">MVP != MicrosoftFanBoy post</a>.  Microsoft will tout that all of the tools are integrated.  I would argue that each of the &#8220;integrated&#8221; tools are pretty close to worst in their class.  I enjoy c# as a language but in general I want to use Visual Studio with ReSharper and then get as far away from the other MS tools as possible.  Disclaimer: I haven&#8217;t used TFS 2010 but in my experience when something is this bad it may get a bit better but rarely will be completely transformed.
<br/><br/>
<big><big><b>Version Control</b>
</big></big><br/>
<br/>I agree with Jonathan&#8217;s assessment that Subversion is a better choice for source control than Team Foundation Version Control(TFVC). I think SVN the gap is quite wide.  Let&#8217;s say we want to use TFS for builds and project management but use SVN (or anything else) for version control.  To the best of my knowledge there is no way to integrate any other version control system with Team Build.
<br/><br/>
Better Choices:  SVN, Git, and Hg.  All of which are free and open source.
<br/><br/>
<big><big><b>Builds</b></big></big>
<br/><br/>
<b>Build Configuration</b><br/>
Let&#8217;s look at Team Build (appropriately abbreviated TB).  Of course
to use TB we need to be using TFVC so we&#8217;ll assume we&#8217;ve made the
mistake of accepting that.
<br/><br/>
TB requires you to name your build file TFSBuild.proj.  Upon kicking off a build it downloads the TFSBuild.proj file and rest of that folder&#8217;s contents to a folder(BuildType) that is nested one level less deep than it&#8217;s location in source control (TeamBuildTypes/MyBuildType).  Not a particularly big deal since the rest of my project won&#8217;t be downloaded until after it attempts to load the .proj file.  Say you wanted to have some shared targets between multiple builds: So far as I can tell, you can&#8217;t do it.  Your .proj file will only be able to use files in it&#8217;s folder and we&#8217;ve already established that there can only be one project per build folder because it forces it to be named TFSBuild.proj.  All I want is for the build files to be co-located with the project and be flexible.
<br/><br/>
<b>
Build Status</b><br/>
I want every team member to be aware of the status of all builds that are relevant to them. TB is integrated with Visual Studio but the interface is awful.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an easy way to see the current status of each build type without having to dig through a list of all builds by date.
<br/><br/>
Build radiators such as a flat screen showing build status or red/green build light are great to have but unless everyone is consistently in view of them we  probably need a tray icon as well.  The only tray icon I could find would show green any time a build was running.  If you have 9 broken builds and one that was in the process of building the icon would show green!
<br/><br/>
When a build fails on TB I almost always have to dig into a raw log to find the details as TB seems to have no intention of giving me the relevant information. Part of this is probably due to that fact that many of the unit tests were NUnit tests.
<br/><br/>
<b>Local Builds</b>
<br/>
In the past while using NAnt running a build before check-in on a developer machine has been a piece of cake.  With TB 2010 I&#8217;ve heard that the option is to shelve some changes and then queue up a private build.  This is still more complicated than just kicking of a build at the command line and will not work at all if disconnected.  Rather than embracing NAnt and NUnit and making sure they we&#8217;re integrated they instead created MSBuild and MSTest to kill off NAnt and NUnit.
<br/><br/>
Better free/open source choices:  Hudson, CC.net(when I last used it in 2005 probably more so now.)<br/>
Better Paid options:  Team City(free for small projects), Go(formerly Cruise)
<br/><br/>
<big><big><b>Project Management</b></big></big>
<br/><br/>
I have minimal experience using the project management part of the suite.  This is due to the fact that almost all of the clients I&#8217;ve worked with have chosen not to use it, even those who seem to blindly take whatever MS gives them.
<br/><br/>
Better Free Choices:  Anyone have suggestions here???<br/>
Better Paid Choices:  Mingle, Version One(last touched in 2005)
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;"><b>Question </b></span><br/>
What would your preferred tool set be if you were starting a .net project today?
<br/>
Considerations: scalable to a large enterprise, easy to use, easy to integrate, easy to maintain,cost
<br/><br/>
My default toolset would look something like:<br/>
Source Control: SVN or Git if the team is distributed<br/>
Development Environment: Visual Studio w/ ReSharper<br/>
Continuous Integration Server: Team City(free for small teams),  Hudson for larger teams or organizations<br/>
Build Scripting: NAnt<br/>
Unit Testing: NUnit<br/>
Project Management: Mingle(free for small projects),  ?? for larger projects<br/>
<br/>
Other than Visual Studio and ReSharper I&#8217;ve avoided anything with a price tag.  There are paid tools that I might prefer but for my default I don&#8217;t want anyone to be able to kill the setup based on budget.
<br/><br/>
I can have most of this set up on my local box in about 30 minutes or set up on a server for the team in a couple hours.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>After reading Ross Petit&#8217;s interesting article on <a href='http://www.rosspettit.com/2010/03/supplying-it-mercenaries.html'><span class='PostTitle'>Supplying IT Mercenaries</span></a> it occurred to me that there is another reason that companies who try to focus on supplying wealth generators(as opposed to income generators) end up having resort to supplying mercenaries so frequently. Sell side firms often see growing the size of their forces as the key piece in increasing their wealth.  <br/><br/>There is a limit to how fast you can effectively increase your forces before the structure becomes unweildy and begins to collapse upon itself.  New forces take resources and time to be appropriately integrated.  In good times highly growth oriented sell side firms attempt to grow as fast as possible.  Supplying inadequately aligned/integrated forces to wealth generating engagements tends to sour those engagements.  <br/> <br/>Because forces seem to be flying out the door, the structure to support these forces lags behind. When a down cycle comes this overgrowth and lagging infrastructure is exposed.  Given the high cost of adding forces, the company attempts to avoid removing forces at all costs. The misaligned forces make it difficult to avoid contraction with wealth generation, thus the company turns to supplying mercenaries.<br/><br/>Given the other effects of supplying mercenary forces that  Ross mentions,  I think that sell side firms would be better off to focus on maximizing wealth generation from existing forces and growing at significantly slower than maximal rate.  While this will likely lower income at peak levels it should also make the troughs less deep.  If hiring and integrating new forces at a more manageable rate helps the firm to avoid mercenary work, this would also lower attrition.  It&#8217;s possible with the lowered attrition that the firm might even grow at the same rate over the longer term with fewer bumps along the way.   <br/></div></div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I&#8217;m against the use of the mouse in most cases.  That&#8217;s not to say that I&#8217;m particularly good at avoiding it.  It requires you to take your hands off the keyboard and breaks up the flow of what you are doing.  There is a solution to this problem, the pointing sticks in the middle of the keyboards. These don&#8217;t require you to stray nearly as far from typing position. They works pretty well but require that you&#8217;re typing on a laptop(an IBM or Dell to be specific).  When you are working on a desktop and not a laptop you&#8217;re pretty much screwed.  Looking around on the web I&#8217;ve seen very few options and most of them have limited availability at best.<br/><br/>In my ideal world I could get something like the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergo-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK'>Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000</a> but with the addition of a pointing stick.  You might say that there are usb keyboards which have a touch pad on them but touchpads aren&#8217;t nearly as integrated and I detest the clunkiness of using them.  This is my opinion and is certainly <a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10010673-1.html'>not unanimous</a>.  It took me a week or two of using a pointing stick to start liking it.<br/><br/>Why is this such a big deal for me?  Even on a desktop, I like to type with the keyboard sitting on top of my thighs.  The side effect of this is that the mouse is nowhere near me.  My alternate computer usage has been sitting on the couch with my computer hooked up to my HDTV.  If you&#8217;ve ever tried to use a traditional mouse on the couch you probably know how quickly the pain comes.  <br/><br/>While my desire for a desktop keyboard with a pointing stick may not be all that common it&#8217;s certainly not unique.  Why don&#8217;t there seem to be keyboards which meet my requirements?  I&#8217;m guessing patents and the company or companies holding them (IBM?).  Does anyone have any good solutions?<br/></div></div>

I&#8217;ve heard and observed that Quality Analysts/ Quality Engineer&#8217;s(QA for the purposes of this post) are often valued a lot less than other members of software development teams.  Here are some of the reasons I&#8217;ve heard in support of this view:<br/>

<ul><li>Following a script and clicking through a website is easy, anyone can do it.
</li><li>We test so we don&#8217;t need someone else to do it.</li><li>They never find any real bugs.</li><li>We&#8217;d rather just have another developer.
</li></ul>
<br/>
I don&#8217;t agree with the perspective so I thought I&#8217;d lay out what I think the QA value proposition is.<br/><br/>

While the entire team must take ownership of the quality of application, the QA&#8217;s are the shepherds of that quality.  If you are simply tossing an untested application over the wall at QA, they will be scrambling(usually ineffectively) to clean up your mess.  To be effective, QA&#8217;s should be full fledged members of your team, co-located with your team, testing in-phase with your team.<br/><br/>

While QA&#8217;s perform a good amount of manual testing they also help create smoke tests, help determine acceptance criteria, help write acceptance tests, and monitor performance testing.
<br/><br/>
While QA&#8217;s may follow some test scripts, they also monitor browser compatibility, find creative ways to break the application, and have keen attention to detail.  They are also able to step back and notice things that escape your eye after viewing the functionality in your story for the thousandth time that day.
<br/><br/>
Good QA&#8217;s help expose defects, find work-arounds, and help the business to prioritize them.  They monitor, minimize, and mitigate the differences between other environments and production.
<br/><br/>
While it&#8217;s certainly possibly to successfully develop quality applications without formal &#8220;QA&#8221;, having good QA&#8217;s around makes it much easier.  I think they are every bit as valuable as other members of the team.
<br/><br/>
When people don&#8217;t see much value in QA&#8217;s, I generally think they haven&#8217;t worked with a good QA or have only worked in environments which make all but the most basic QA work impossible (i.e. &#8220;After 6 months, here is our first testable release. We have to be in production in a week.  Good luck.&#8221;).
<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left out many other things.  How else do QA&#8217;s provide value to projects?</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I have some thoughts on offshoring that I&#8217;d be interested in getting some feedback on.  Agree/disagree at will.<br/><br/>If a software developer (BA,QA,PM, etc.) is little more than a typist then it makes perfect sense.   <br/>If I send work offshore it costs me 1/X times my onshore rates. <br/><br/>Let&#8217;s assume the average skill level is more or less the same onshore and offshore.  This has been my experience with my fellow thoughtworkers. <br/><br/>To make things easy let&#8217;s also assume a programmer in your favorite offshoring location (I chose India because it has the best food :) ) commands a salary that is 1/9th that of an onshore developer. I made up this number based on the first salary numbers I could find on the net. ( Indian developer ~10k USD (~450k INR), US developer ~90k USD)  If I&#8217;m way off let me know in the comments.<br/><br/>Even the most optimistic person will agree that there is some additional overhead that goes along with this setup.  For Example, network connections between the offices, additional development servers, and a certain amount of overlap of roles in each place.  Given our 1/9th multiplier these costs seem pretty minor. <br/><br/>There are other more substantial issues:  <br/><ul><li>Employee morale decreases on both ends when people constantly have to work late or get up early to have meetings across a wide spread of time zones. <br/></li><li>Network sluggishness makes sharing a common code repository difficult and leads to long  check-in cycles and/or painful merges.</li><li>Communicating requirements through typed documents is not effective and is even less so when crossing cultural boundaries.</li><li>People are blocked and can&#8217;t continue their work because they need answers from people who are not available.  <br/></li><li>Transparency is often low within a single office.  It&#8217;s almost non-existent when you add many time zones and thousands of miles to the mix.</li></ul><br/>The drags on productivity listed above can be mitigated to a fair extent:<br/><ul><li>Have team members alternate spending chunks of time working in both locations.  Getting to know all members of the team and working side by side with them in the trenches will increase morale, communication, and transparency.  Video conferencing equipment can help as well but isn&#8217;t a substitute for working together face to face.  This is a pretty significant cost.<br/></li><li>Collaboration tools like Mingle and Cruise can help keep people on the same page and ensure that you aren&#8217;t stepping on each other&#8217;s toes. (yep, I&#8217;m plugging my employer&#8217;s products)</li><li>Distributed version control such as Git or Mercurial are supposed to help with some of the repository issues.<br/></li></ul>When all of this is added up does offshore development actually cost less?  What have you observed?<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that on average the chances of poor outcomes are higher and the costs may not be significantly different.  <br/><br/>Why do I suspect that this is the case?  Here&#8217;s an anecdote for what I imagine is the average case of offshoring:<br/>Company A spends a lot of money on their in-house product development.  CTO Smith observes that development is slow(and getting slower) and that Company A is getting a poor return on their investment.  Because programming is like typing, they need more typists&#8230; at a lower cost.  They hire a larger number of programmers via the lowest rate offshoring firm available.  The project starts slowly.  When the project is well behind schedule the answer is to increase resources significantly, incurring additional cost.  Not much if anything is delivered and the quality of deliverables is very low.  <br/><br/>This is <b>not</b> a condemnation of offshoring. It&#8217;s a condemnation of that idea that a company which doesn&#8217;t run consistently successful projects onshore will be successful in running projects offshore.  It&#8217;s a challenge to find high performing people.  It&#8217;s a challenge to run successful projects.  Even under good conditions some projects will fail.  Offshoring adds additional challenges.  <br/><br/>Is it worth it to take on these additional challenges?<br/><br/>I think in many cases it is.  If we reviewed successfully offshored projects what would we find? My guess is we&#8217;d find consistently successful deliveries with costs in the realm of 1/2 to 1/3 what it would cost to develop onshore(I just made up these numbers.  Lawyered!).  These companies took the opportunity to scale up(or replace?) their already successful onshore development operation.  They would do so by creating a high end offshore team.  <br/><br/>Assuming my hypothesis is correct, I further suggest:<br/><ul><li>Quality BA&#8217;s, Developers, QA&#8217;s, PM&#8217;s are hard to find.  Offshoring should be utilized to scale up because you will have a  larger pool to draw from. You will assume  additional risk however you may also save a significant amount of money.  <br/></li><li>If costs are really the main driver for outsourcing, I think a company considering outsourcing should do two things:  1. Take a long hard look at why development is so expensive (and/or results are so poor) in your organization.  What makes you think doing things offshore will produce different results.  2. Consider co-locating the entire team, including stakeholders and business owners, offshore for the duration of the project. </li><li>Project success is impacted much more by the abilities of the people on the team than where the project is developed.  if you&#8217;re hiring average typists, you&#8217;re probably ok.  If you&#8217;re hiring average software developers, you&#8217;re in for a lot of pain regardless of where they are physically located.</li></ul><br/>What do you think?<br/></div></div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Whenever I roll on to a new client there are a few things that I find to be leading indicators for the success of the engagement.<br/><ul><li>How long it takes to get a badge/computer/access to the building.  Hopefully this stuff is ready and waiting when you arrive. I have seen cases where a badge takes a few weeks and a computer takes up to two months.  It&#8217;s particularly awesome if they won&#8217;t provide you with a computer and won&#8217;t allow your computer on their network.  If I don&#8217;t have all of this stuff by the end of the first week on the client it&#8217;s a bad sign.    <br/></li><li>The amount of time it takes before I hear the first mention of filing a ticket.  Something like &#8220;Here is your laptop, if you want a mouse or keyboard file a separate ticket for each and we&#8217;ll get them for you.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve really come to hate the words &#8220;file a ticket&#8221;, particularly when preceded by &#8220;I forgot to&#8221; and followed by &#8220;so that won&#8217;t be ready for a few weeks.&#8221;</li><li>Availability of client personnel.  If the people I&#8217;m supposed to be working with are MIA or are splitting time with a bunch of other projects I lose a bit of confidence.  <br/></li></ul>I used to have a few more which seem to have slipped my mind.  Do you have any other early indicators for project/engagement success or failure? <br/> <br/></div></div>

<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><font style='font-weight: bold;'><font style='font-weight: bold;'><br/></font></font><font><font>H</font></font><font>ow are large companies like heroin addicts you ask?</font><br/><ol><li>They make excuses and/or deny the problem. My favorite is: How bad
could we be? We&#8217;re a billion dollar company! When I hear this, I wonder
how many companies have gone billion dollar balance sheets to
bankruptcy in a short amount of time.  Think about Amtrak, the major
airlines&#8230;size won&#8217;t save your business.</li><li>They can&#8217;t maintain focus and their priorities shift constantly. The
new highest priority is either the shiniest thing in view or whomever
is shouting the loudest.</li><li>When they do decide to change, they&#8217;re often only partly committed. </li><li>During the transition, managers are paranoid that you&#8217;re out to get them.  They think the changes will take away their kingdoms.  Developers are paranoid that people will find out that they don&#8217;t know how to write a test.  QA&#8217;s are paranoid because nobody tells them what to expect until they don&#8217;t have enough time to deal with it.  The business is paranoid that they&#8217;re not getting a return from their expensive IT department.<br/></li><li><font>They often flounder through short lived attempts to reform before reverting to their old ways.</font> Management goes back to constant fire fighting.  They could quit fire fighting if they wanted to, but this stuff is extremely important!  <br/></li></ol><font><br/>Recovery for many large companies is about as likely as it is for a heroin addict.  It is possible but it usually requires a few things:<br/></font><ol><li><font> They need to hit rock bottom.  A five year project that cost millions and delivered nothing.  A few days with the production servers down and money flowing out the door.<br/></font></li><li><font> They need to be committed to making serious change from the top of the organization to the bottom.<br/></font></li><li>They need to treat the problems that led down this path in the first place.<br/></li></ol>Given the challenges that companies face in transitioning to agile, what do they need to increase their odds of success?<br/><ol><li><font>Guidance from people who have successfully transitioned.  I don&#8217;t mean a coach or two for a couple days.  When transitioning, the team generally needs to have at least 50% experienced practitioners for at least a few months.  To successfully go below the 50% threshold requires a very high level of motivation from those adopting the agile mindset and XP practices. Even with high motivation, it will take one on one support or the drive to spend a lot of extra time on their own.<br/></font></li><li><font>Cross-functional teams with a strong preference for co-location.  The more inter-team hand-offs it takes to get a project developed and deployed, the less likely the project is to succeed.  Getting the stakeholders, BA&#8217;s, developers, QA&#8217;s, support staff, and IT dedicated to this cross-functional team and to share the same physical space will increase the odds of success significantly. <br/></font></li><li><font>Transparency.  Bring out all the warts and underlying issues.  Make sure everyone understands the problems and issues at hand.  If people don&#8217;t agree that there is a problem, they&#8217;re unlikely to participate in solving it.  In the worst case, a project can be cancelled early. in the best case, problems can be mitigated or resolved and the project delivered. <br/></font></li><li><font>A shared vision of where the business wants to go.   It&#8217;s very difficult to put full effort into going somewhere if you don&#8217;t share the same map.</font></li><li><font>Some quick wins.  If team members see signs of improvement, it can help them sustain their efforts through the instability and insecurity that comes with any change.</font></li></ol></div></div>
